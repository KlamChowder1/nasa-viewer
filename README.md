## Notes

As I started working on this project, I became more and more invested in it, as simply making an image viewer to display images didn’t really seem that fun or interactive.

I decided to make things a bit more engaging for myself and decided that I would make the image viewing site more like a site to “purchase” the photos. 

The inspiration of creating a picture purchasing site came from thinking how Shopify impacts people in a positive manner, and how I can create something similar to make commerce better for everyone as well.
